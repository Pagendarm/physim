physim
======

A physics simulation language, designed to allow concise descriptions of physics problems and simulations written in Scala. Input will be a simple Scala program using the created library. Output will be formatted text files and generated graphics written in HTML 5 and Javascript. The simplest version could be useful for educational purposes, but it is intended to be written with enough flexibility to be expanded to more complex simulations/applications.


###Naming Conventions
Scala files are named lower case \_ seperated,
classes and objects are camelCase.

e.g. basic\_test.scala is the src file for BasicTest.class (or $.class)

###Directory Structure
Most directories are managed by the package structure of 
Scala to maintain simplicity, the folowing two contain
source files and are visable in the repository

* src/ *contains all src files*

* tests/ *contains test files for development*

###Package Structure

* general
	* Constants

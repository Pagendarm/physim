physim
======

A physics simulation language, designed to allow concise descriptions of physics problems and simulations written in Scala. Input will be a simple Scala program using the created library. Output will be formatted text files and generated graphics written in HTML 5 and Javascript. The simplest version could be useful for educational purposes, but it is intended to be written with enough flexibility to be expanded to more complex simulations/applications.
